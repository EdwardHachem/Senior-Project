## Overview
<body>
  Abusive/toxic relationships are the root of many problems our society faces today. Whether itâ€™s physical, emotional, mental, or verbal, we have a responsibility to our communities and society at large to protect ourselves and others from unhealthy relationships. Integrating research-backed indicators of abuse and technology is a popular and growing subset of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The team will create a web scraper to mine videos of conversations from youtube. A tool will be created in python to listen to the conversations and mark if the audio has indicators of verbal abuse or aggression. The results will be stored in a database on AWS for pattern analysis.
The goal of this project is to develop a tool that can help us detect when we or someone else is being aggressive in order to recognize and improve on toxic relationships.
